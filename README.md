# Chautari

“Chautari”, (Nepali: चौतारी), is a common (normally central) place in a community where people gather and talk on various topic, discuss on stuffs and take decisions. It’s an open & free place where anyone in the community can participate both actively or passively. 

We are creating hub trying to build an ecosystem for techies with willingness to share and grow together.

## Our Focus

Basically, we focus on these sector, (but not limited to)

### Free working space

provides free space for working on the projects, in return one would help the community by helping and taking part actively in other components such as building the space, promoting the space or maybe contributing with resources.

### Idea sharing platform

Meetups: finding good venue for meetup has become tedious thing, we can use the space as a common place for hosting meetups of different communities working in Kathmandu/Nepal. 

Unconference/OpenSpace conference : Taking idea from barcamp and similar events we can provide a space to share ideas maybe on weekends, ideas can be collected via website or directly announcing on the very day.

### Early adopter culture

Nepal ( and most of the South Asia) lacks this culture. To boost this culture, we give Startups or entrepreneurs to showcase their product, volunteers and others associated with this organisation, helps by testing the product, giving their reactions, suggestion (good or bad) , also sharing their thoughts on the product by blogging and sharing via social media.

### Help, share and grow together (MUST)

Best thing about this space is help, share and grow together. One gets space to work for own’s project, in return helps in other project to grow or help in global open projects like Mozilla, wikipedia, different projects in githubs
The people working in the space can collaborate with one another and share collective intelligence to boost the overall technological environment of Nepal. A possible idea is, small projects of many people working there may be combined into one huge project which can help a lot of people.
